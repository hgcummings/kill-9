Overall concept:
 * Multiplayer battle royale (a la Tetris-99 or Pacman-99) for 9 players
 * Central game a simple tile-slider (like Threes or 2048)
 * Send "garbage" to other players in the form of extra tiles
 * Target number 9
  * going over this is a bust (card just disappears) but just clears some space
  * hitting this gets you points and sends garbage to other players

Themeing:
 * Some combination of Threes/TIS-100/old fashioned terminals
 * Might be fun if the control scheme in some way made people appear to be "hackertyping"

Scoring:
 * Could be expressed in "kills" (for eliminating other players) and "nines"

Pre-submit todo:
 * Handle server disconnect
 * Show garbage queue
 * Fancier spinner
 * Submit to competition site
